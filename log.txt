==========
* Fixed a crash during GP initialization

2016-03-30
==========
* GOT IT COMPILING AGAIN!

2016-03-15
==========
* Finished GP skeleton, bayesopt interface
* TODO: Make sure it actually works as expected 

2016-03-14
==========
* Finished adding observations to state from before
* Added models to domain
* TODO: Pretty up the domain info string
* Started filling out GP
* Added experiment action, finally.
* Finished experiment action type begin/end
* todo: Finish GP skeleton

2016-03-10
==========
* Changed test domain to have an experiment action.
* Fixed small display bug in domain's info.

2016-03-09
==========
* Built Model/GP skeletons
* Finally got bayesopt submodule all working + compiling
* Starting to add models
* Added experiment action type + factory
* todo: Complete action type stuff once models are done.

2016-03-08
==========
* Got cancel action half-implemented- dumb reference bug.
* Finished cancellation.
* todo: Convert Action::List to list-of-pointers.
* Finished the above.
* TODO: Finish actions w/ upkeep costs
* Started experiment action

2016-03-07
==========
* Fixed small simulator bug- multiple actions can be started in the same
timestep now.
* Added cancelable flag

2016-03-03
==========
* Made arbiter ask a policy for actions at decision points
* Got simple human policy working

2016-02-29
==========
* Got action beginning/ending working.
* Found dumb solution to circularly-defined type aliases.

2016-02-26
==========
* Added first stab at state transition to simulator.
* todo: upkeep costs, action finishing/starting functions

2016-02-25
==========
* Fixed odd segfault-- member variable was const reference instead of just
const.
* Added Action class
* todo: I should add a state factory
* Added simulator skeleton
* Added running action list to state
* Added domain/state factories
* Addde action type factory

2016-02-24
==========
* Built out more of the skeleton for state/resources/actions. Next step is
action records and state transition to start building the simulator.
* Odd segfault?

2016-02-22
==========
* Recompiled llvm/clang from source to correctly point at the gcc5.2 headers,
loaded the correct libstdc++, and recompiled YCM. Code completion works!

2016-02-20
==========
* Got YCM to use the locally-installed clang for error checking, fixed build 
systems. Seems to all work!
* Started resource/action skeletons.
* Found issues with pulling from gcc 4.4.7 headers.

2016-02-19
==========
* Realized my syntax checker doesn't support c++14 correctly. Spent a long time 
getting llvm/clang built locally. Hopefully it works.

2016-02-18
==========
* Initial environment setup
