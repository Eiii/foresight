==========
* Recompiled llvm/clang from source to correctly point at the gcc5.2 headers,
loaded the correct libstdc++, and recompiled YCM. Code completion works!

==========
* Got YCM to use the locally-installed clang for error checking, fixed build 
systems. Seems to all work!
* Started resource/action skeletons.
* Found issues with pulling from gcc 4.4.7 headers.

==========
* Realized my syntax checker doesn't support c++14 correctly. Spent a long time 
getting llvm/clang built locally. Hopefully it works.
