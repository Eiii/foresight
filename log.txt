==========
* Fixed small simulator bug- multiple actions can be started in the same
timestep now.

2016-03-03
==========
* Made arbiter ask a policy for actions at decision points
* Got simple human policy working

2016-02-29
==========
* Got action beginning/ending working.
* Found dumb solution to circularly-defined type aliases.

2016-02-26
==========
* Added first stab at state transition to simulator.
* TODO: upkeep costs, action finishing/starting functions

2016-02-25
==========
* Fixed odd segfault-- member variable was const reference instead of just
const.
* Added Action class
* TODO: I should add a state factory
* Added simulator skeleton
* Added running action list to state
* Added domain/state factories
* Addde action type factory

2016-02-24
==========
* Built out more of the skeleton for state/resources/actions. Next step is
action records and state transition to start building the simulator.
* Odd segfault?

2016-02-22
==========
* Recompiled llvm/clang from source to correctly point at the gcc5.2 headers,
loaded the correct libstdc++, and recompiled YCM. Code completion works!

2016-02-20
==========
* Got YCM to use the locally-installed clang for error checking, fixed build 
systems. Seems to all work!
* Started resource/action skeletons.
* Found issues with pulling from gcc 4.4.7 headers.

2016-02-19
==========
* Realized my syntax checker doesn't support c++14 correctly. Spent a long time 
getting llvm/clang built locally. Hopefully it works.

2016-02-18
==========
* Initial environment setup
