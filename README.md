# foresight

foresight is a library that is meant to provide the tools to simulate and evaluate policies for stochastic resource-constrained scheduling problems. 

At present, the project is more of a development sandbox than a finished or functional library. In its current configuration, foresight is built to test joint scheduling+optimization problems in which the events to be scheduled can either consume or produce resources, and may result in a noisy observation of the objective function to be maximized.
